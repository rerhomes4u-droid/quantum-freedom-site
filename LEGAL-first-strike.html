NOTICE OF LIABILITY AND CEASE & DESIST

Date: ${currentDate}
To: ${entity}
From: ${name}

REGARDING: ${mandate}

1. This notice serves as formal communication that the aforementioned mandate is unlawful and violates fundamental, inalienable rights.

2. The "Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act" (PREP Act) of 2005, which provides immunity for "covered countermeasures," was passed through an illegitimate process, attached to a defense bill after hours without a proper vote. It is a fraudulent law enabling a pre-meditated crime against humanity.

3. Forcing any medical intervention, especially an experimental gene therapy with known severe adverse effects and no long-term safety data, is a direct violation of the Nuremberg Code, established to prevent the exact medical atrocities being committed today.

4. By enforcing this mandate, you are acting as an agent of an illegal and genocidal program. Be advised that you, as an individual, can be held personally, civilly, and criminally liable for participating in and enforcing these crimes.

5. I DO NOT CONSENT to any medical procedure. I am a living soul created by God, not a subject of your corporate authority.

CEASE AND DESIST immediately. Any further action to enforce this mandate will be met with the full force of lawful recourse.

UNDERSTAND: This is not a debate. This is a formal notice of your liability.

Sincerely,

${name}
[Attached: Claim of the Life - Affidavit of Status]
